A simple Space Invaders clone I made with Unity 2021 LTS in about a week. The project uses Model-View-Presenter architecture, dependency injection and reactive programming. Asset loading is handled with Addressables. The game uses Zenject factories and memory pools to improve preformance. The user interface was made using Unity UI and TextMeshPro and the animations were done with tweening. The game logic is fully covered with Unit tests using NUnit and NSubstitute.
